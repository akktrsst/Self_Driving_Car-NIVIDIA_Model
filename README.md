Overview
In this project, we leverage the power of the NVIDIA model to enable a car to navigate autonomously. The NVIDIA model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to predict steering angles from images captured by an on-board camera. The model can be fine-tuned and trained on a specific dataset, allowing it to learn to drive based on real-world data.

This repository provides:

Code: Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment on an autonomous vehicle platform.
Datasets: Sample datasets for training and testing the model.
Documentation: Detailed instructions and explanations to help you get started with building your self-driving car.
